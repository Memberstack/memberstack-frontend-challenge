# Memberstack Frontend Challenge

## Preface

Hello! ðŸ‘‹ We're excited to be sending you **Memberstack's Frontend Challenge.** Before we get into what you'll be building, we want to start by saying:

- **This code is yours**. It will be kept private and only ever used for evaluation purposes.
- **Your time is valuable**. We don't expect you to work on this for more than **2 hours**.
- **We're here to help**. If you're stuck or need clarification, please don't hesistate to reach out. You can email nic@memberstack.com with "Frontend Coding Challenge" in the subject line.

## What you'll be building

The challenge is divided into two parts:

1. A host page
2. An iFramed chat button

The host page has a `ColorPicker` and `ChatBotIFrame`. When a user selects a color, the chat button color should change in real-time (this is to say there should be no perceptible delay). When you start the application you will notice that the user can pick a color, but nothing happens.

## Objectives

Your challenge is as follows:

1. Create a way to update the chat button color when the user selects a color.
2. Persist the color such that color choice is maintained upon page refresh.

**Bonus:** The project styles are currently only using vanilla CSS. Implement your preferred tool for styling, and make one design improvement to the website.

**Note:** If you run out of time, that's okay! We have left a `NOTES.md` file for you to provide an explanation for your solution, as well as give you an opportunity to tell us about what else you would have built if you had more time.

## Getting started

Before you begin, please fork this project. If you choose to keep the repository prviate, please remember to invite the following Memberstack team members as collaborators: `NicHaley`, `tbell511`, and `lydiahallie`.

This project uses [Lerna monorepos](https://github.com/lerna/lerna) to manage two React applications. To start the application simply run:

```
yarn bootstrap
```

then

```
yarn start
```

## Assessment

Your code will be evaluated based on:

- System architecture
- Code quality
- Notes explanation

**Code quality > completion**. An incomplete submission with strong code and explanation is better than a rushed but complete submission.
